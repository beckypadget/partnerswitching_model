This is the code for the model described in 'Choosing friends in an uncertain world: information reduces relationship stability in a Bayesian learning model of cooperative partnership'.

* individual-behaviour.ipynb -- this is the code for Part 1 of the model, which shows when an individual should switch from a current partner based on the time spent with that partner and its cooperativeness (relative to the population, depending on parameters)
* model-classic.ipynb -- this is the code for Part 2 of the model, in which a population of animals interacts according to the rules given by Part 1
* model-adjustment.ipynb -- this is the code for Part 2 of the model, in which a population of animals interacts according to the rules given by Part 1; additionally, animals can now choose to adjust their cooperativeness following a poor payoff.
